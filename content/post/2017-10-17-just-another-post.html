<p>I have finally decided to try my hands on blogging again, only this round with markdown with rstudio. This blog will also serve as a means to keep track and records of various small projects and interest i have done so far.</p>
<p>I will start with posting previously achieved projects. I should be able to update it rather frequently since I’m pretty free these days.</p>
<p>by default, highcharter does not seems to work properly on rblogdown at the moment, this means that kernal/analysis that i did using highcharter wouldn’t be uploaded here. They still work fine on Kaggle thankfully.</p>
